	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
		Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
		environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
	<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
		elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
		purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
			Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
			form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
		<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
			server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
			continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
			on a server.</li>
	</ul>
